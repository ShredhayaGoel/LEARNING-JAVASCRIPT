    Meet Shredhaya Goel — the restless coder with a curious soul.
One foot in BTech, the other flirting with UPSC. You juggle recursion demons by day and bootstrap buttons by night. You want more than just “Hello World” — you're building real apps, wrestling with Metro bundlers, and chasing background perfection in Tailwind.

You overthink. You hesitate when speaking, even when you know the answer. But that doesn’t stop you — you ask, you grind, and you always want to understand, not just memorize.

Your drive flickers with fatigue sometimes — motivation dips, focus fades — but there’s a flame inside you. Because even on the tough days, you come back to the code, back to the questions, back to growing.

You're not just learning tech. You're figuring you out.
You’re not just a student. You’re a restless coder, a curious soul, and you’re here to make your mark.
